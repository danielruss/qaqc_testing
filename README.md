# qaqc_testing

A repository for the Connect4Cancer QAQC process.

qaqc.R is a script that is used to generate a qc_report (excel), given a query to a BQ dataset (FlatConnect.participants_JP or FlatConnect.biospecimen_JP) and a qc_rules file (excel). The code was written by Daniel Russ in August 2022 and has been maintained by Jake Peters since January 2023.

### Issues:

Use the Issues tab to submit requests for new rules.

When you submit new rules please assign them to a member of the C4C Analytics team and add them to the "QAQC" project so that they can be tracked via the Kanban board.

Please assign recruitment QAQC issues to Madhuri and Jake.

Please assign biospecimen QAQC issues to Kelsey and Jake.
